## BMotion Studio 2

BMotion Studio 2 is a visual editor for creating domain specific visualisations of formal models with support for Event-B, Classical-B and CSP. The tool is not officially released yet, but the source code is available [here](https://github.com/bendisposto/prob2).

## Try out the lift example

* Clone this repository.
* [Download](http://www.stups.hhu.de/bmotionstudio/index.php/Downloads) the BMotionStudio 2 standalone version for your operating system.
* Unzip the archive and navigate to the bin folder.
* Start BMotionStudio passing the template file as a first argument. For example:

```
./BMotionStudio ~/GIT/BMotionStudio_Tutorial/examples/lift/lift.html

Thats all! Your default browser should open with the lift visualisation running.
